**How To Node** put something in bold by enclosing it in `**double stars**`

This article will describe how the blog works.  Read on and I will describe how to contribute new articles for others to enjoy.  You will also want to add your author profile to the site.

## This site runs on Wheat ##

In order to create a section heading, type `##double hashes##` around the text that you want to make into a header.  Put the text on a line by itself with a blank line before and after.  Links and citation formatting of article text is also a built-in feature of Markdown syntax.

The upstream owner, [creationix], built this software with [node], the client/serverside JavaScript library.  The sources (freely copied) live at [github], known as [howtonode.org], the location of the primary publically deployed instance of the site, where all of their authors post.  We got our site layout directly from them.

Thanks, howtonode!
