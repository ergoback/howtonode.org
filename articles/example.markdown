This article will describe how the blog works.  Read on and I will describe how
to contribute new articles for others to enjoy.  You will also want to add your
author profile to the site.  I will try to help you with this every step of the
way, but you're going to have to learn to write to your own git repository or
we're going to have problems going forward.

## This site runs on Wheat ##

In order to create a section heading, type `##double hashes##` around the text
that you want to make into a header.  Put the text on a line by itself with a
blank line before and after.  Links and citation formatting of article text is
also a built-in feature of Markdown syntax.

The upstream owner, [creationix], built this software with [node], the
client/serverside JavaScript library.  The sources (freely copied) live at
[github], known as [howtonode.org], the location of the primary publically
deployed instance of the site, where all of their authors post.  We got our
site layout directly from them.

Thanks, howtonode!
