Title: Second Judge in State Backs Local Ban on Gas Drilling
Author: THE NEW YORK TIMES
Date: Fri Feb 24 2012


Middlefield, with about 2,100 residents, passed a zoning law last June against
industrial use of land, including oil and gas drilling. A landowner who had
leased 377 acres to a gas company for drilling finds herself on the business
end of the town's ordinance in favor of conservation,
and [will likely appeal the decision] of State Supreme Court justice
Donald F. Cerio Jr. ruling in favor of the municipality, coming down hard
against the local landowner's argument that only the state could regulate
natural gas drilling.
