Title: Second Judge in State Backs Local Ban on Gas Drilling

Middlefield, with about 2,100 residents, passed a zoning law last June
prohibiting heavy industry uses of land, including oil and gas drilling. Three
months later, a landowner who had leased 377 acres of land to a gas company for
drilling sued the town, arguing that only the state could regulate natural gas
drilling.

The landowner, Jennifer K. Huntington, a dairy farmer and president of
Cooperstown Holstein Corporation, said in the suit that the law denied her
company the economic benefits of the leases, including the right to market
its minerals, including oil and natural gas.

But an acting State Supreme Court justice, Donald F. Cerio Jr., found that New
York law did not prohibit municipalities from enacting legislation pertaining
to land use. He said that while the state had regulatory powers over the method
and manner of drilling and the like so that the gas industry operated under
uniform standards statewide, local governments could decide whether they wanted
drilling at all.

The decision was similar to the one rendered on Tuesday by Justice Phillip R.
Rumsey, which upheld a drilling ban in Dryden, in Tompkins County, in a lawsuit
brought by an oil and gas company.

Both decisions are expected to be appealed.
